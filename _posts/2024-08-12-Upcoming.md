Ladies and gentlemen, It is *not* with my pride and joy that I present to you, my upcoming project: gitted

I don't want to say a lot about it right now, as to keep its features or whatever a suprise, but I will say this:

Gitted is a command-line tool that is made to make the git LI life easier.

Shoutout to anybody who actually cares
