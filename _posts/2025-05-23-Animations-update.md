It's not done, obviously, or those tweaks would be here, however, all of my work so far,
and what will *eventually* be on this site, will be beta tested and thus seen at that

input device, I do not posess the required knowledge to answer this information quickly and
easily, and thus, I must assure that you are aware of this.  
***tl;dr:** "idk" but fancy.*
