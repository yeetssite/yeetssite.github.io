Before you ask why i apparently have 4 accounts on github, I dont. Two of them are old accounts I actually dont have access to, but theoretically anyone could contribute as by using the right git credentials(However, it doesnt matter as you still need valid github credentials and they aren't verified like my current accounts, *yeetssite* and *mangolover1899*.

 # Lol this is my website :)

And if you look above this README, you'll notice how big and convoluted it is...

it uses the [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com "google fonts this way") library that way it can load fonts without needing the user to have them installed. ~~It also uses a [live markdown translator](https://md-block.verou.me/ "its called 'md-block'. We stopped using it because it doesnt work on older devices.") for quality-of-life and to edit pages faster~~ I stopped using a live MD translator, as it does not work on older systems. See, my mission is to create a meme site that can be quickly accessed on almost any device with a web browser, new *and* old. To keep things simple, I'm trying to use code compatible with at least any old windows XP, OS X, iOS 6, and Android 4 system. This site was originally developed using the [default chromeOS text editor](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/text-app "You've been banished to the google chrome text app repo"), [ChromeOS 72](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2019/02/stable-channel-update-for-chrome-os.html "Get google blogged"), [Crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton "Look, a dead Linux on chromebooks thing!") and an [HP CB2 chromebook (2013? I think?)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.amazon.com/HP-Chromebook-11-1101-White-Blue/dp/B00FJXVRM8&ved=2ahUKEwj3ncH9puCEAxUVLtAFHVxTAYoQFnoECDQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1L2ER1v4WkBOxi9Rbm-joW "amazon page for the dead thing") with write protect disable (chromeos nerds know what I'm talking about). I recently migrated over to the github web client and vsc(visual studio) for ubuntu and here we are today. I hope you have fun seeing my memes and don't try to hack the source code or I will pull up your ip and dns and pin it to my wall of shame.
