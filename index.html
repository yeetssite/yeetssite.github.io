        <h3>How has this survived?</h3>
        <p>
          This site has been through a lot of <text class="rdrtext">fucking</text> <text class="rdrtextred">gay</text> stuff, but through it all, it has stayed alive and well.
      </p>
       <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>
        It's called "backups", you dummy. Anyways, I'm not here to to do a QnA,
        I'm here to tell you...

      <h2>...What this site's about:</h2>
       <p>
         Erm, Acktchully ðŸ¤“, this site isn't really about anything in particular, just about stuff that I'm intrested in.

         Find anything here intresting? Cool, there's probably a good chance I'm not into that anymore, and won't be doing anything related to it in the future.
