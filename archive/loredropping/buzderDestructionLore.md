Okay so basically one day i was in this server called priyom and had an argument with this linkfanel guy, it started when I saw him get all redditory and toxic towards somebody else, so I made joke about it, next thing he was pinging me with some very mild insult, and eventually he muted me. I thought "ok, that's that, im coming back later" when he DMed me like "what is your problem?" and I told him something about my problem being him getting so angry over a light joke, and so we started arguing and shit back and forth, and at one point I remember this motherfucker quoting rick and morty saying hes "totally got ricks i-dont-give-a-fuck mentality..."

...Bro, you *are not* rick and morty you crusty french canadian named "Peirre" :sob:... So anyways, the argument continued on and on and he kept reacting to my messages with "ðŸ™„" emojis, until eventually hes like "Youre warned"

and the conversation quickly ends from there. It's funny, looking back, because I told him "You have good patience, most discord mods would've banned me by now." I was banned the next day. During the initial argument, someone named "Kat" would DM me and invite me to **"The buzzer channel server"**, and during the DMs argument with linkfanel, I was posting screenshots in *SFC* and The buzzer channel. I was having a decent time in The buzzer channel when suddenly, I got a ping from the discord mðŸ¤¢ds running the server, saying that all the channels were locked due to some "drama." I suddenly got a DM from this kat girl explaining that the owner of the server, *named* "The buzder channel" was homophobic. 

It took some time but we have evidence, in [This server](http://yeetssite.ddns.net/redirect.html "Goofy aah name").

We were DMing people this copypasta:

```
Did you know that buzzer is homophobic? He keeps doing this bs

We are putting an end to this, and if you want more proof that buzzer is a homophobe, you can visit http://yeetssite.ddns.net/redirect.html to see more evidence

*You are receiving this message because you are in the buzzer channel server.*
```

But, almost immediatly, The buzzer channel turned off this thing that I didn't even know existed called "Shared server DMs" which stopped us from DMing people. So we turned to spamming the server, but quickly found out that all forms of an invitation to our server were blacklisted and gives you a 10 minute timeout. So, here we are now; I have a url that will redirect people to the server, and can manage past buzzders blacklist: http://yeetssite.ddns.net

And I have invited my good friend, **Nick_The_Judge** to help coordinate the trolling and absolutely destroy The buzzer channel server with god tier gay black porn and copypastas cuz, you know, homophobia and *totally not for fun...*
