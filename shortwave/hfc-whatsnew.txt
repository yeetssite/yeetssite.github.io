.IMPORTANT!
If you are seeing this message, please note that you are running a slightly
outdated version of HFcond. Don't worry, though, because you don't HAVE to update 
HFcond for it to work. You're just gonna be missing some features such as this page
being updated for your version. 

.Why won't this page be updated anymore?
Simple: this page has moved to a new URL 
<https://yeetssite.github.io/hfcond/whatsnew.txt> to simplify development.

.Updating
Remember, you don't HAVE to update if you don't want to. Your version of HFcond 
should still be able to get the Geophysical alert and other stuff from NOAA, unless
they decide to change URLs and where that stuff's located.

However, if you wanna update, simply grab an updated version from 
<https://github.com/yeetssite/hfcond> and use it like you would this version.

To check if your version is an updated one that will recieve updated "whatsnew"
messages, run the program with the '-v' option (ex. your command would be something
like 'hfcond -v'). Text like this will appear:

~/$ hfcond version X.XXX

The 'X.XX' is the version you are running. To receive new whatsnew
messages, the version must be 1.031 or later. The last version of hfcond that will 
show THIS message is 1.03.
