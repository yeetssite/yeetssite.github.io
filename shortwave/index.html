<p>As defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio">Wikipedia</a>, shortwave radio is radio transmission using radio frequencies in the shortwave bands (SW). There is no official definition of the band range, but it always includes all of the high frequency band (HF), which extends from 3 to 30 MHz (100 (exactly 99.930819333) to 10 (exactly 9.9930819333) meters); above the medium frequency band (MF), to the bottom of the VHF band.

<p>Basically, it uses something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave">radio waves</a> to bounce off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle">ever-changing particles</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere">ionosphere</a>, which is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization">ionized</a>(so many big words and links to wikipedia, lol) part of earth's atmosphere(which I'm sure you all know what is, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth">here you go</a>) ranging from around 48Km(30Mi) to 965Km(600Mi) above sea level and come back to planet earth, "over the horizon" as wikipedia says. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave">Skywave/skip propagation</a>, and it offers a far better range than standard AM/FM frequencies/radios do. Think of it like "pre-internet internet."

<p>This section of my site will document my encounters with radio stuff, and radio-related stuff I'm intrested in.
   A little, like, list thingy with links and stuff will be coming soon.
