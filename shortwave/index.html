<p>As defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio">Wikipedia</a>, shortwave radio is radio transmission using radio frequencies in the shortwave bands (SW). There is no official definition of the band range, but it always includes all of the high frequency band (HF), which extends from 3 to 30 MHz (100 (exactly 99.930819333) to 10 (exactly 9.9930819333) meters); above the medium frequency band (MF), to the bottom of the VHF band.

<p>Basically, shortwave radio works by emitting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave">radio waves</a> into the sky. These waves then bounce off of a part of Earth's atmosphere called the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere">ionosphere</a>", then returns to Earth at different regions around the world.</p>
<p><b>tl;dr</b>: shooting things into the sky so they come back somewhere's else</p>

<p>This section of my site will document my encounters with radio stuff, and radio-related stuff I'm intrested in.
   A little, like, list thingy with links and stuff will be coming soon.
